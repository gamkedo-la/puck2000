# Overview

Puck2000 is a 1v1 video game adaptation of a board game involving pucks divided equally between the two players on a play field that is split in two and divided by a barrier with an opening.

Each player has to get their pucks through the opening in the middle to land it into their opponentâ€™s side. The player who gets rid of all their pucks from their side wins.

# Design Notes

Game Engine: Godot 3.5.2 Stable (LTS)
Target Platform: HTML5 WebGL build only
Renderer: GLES2 - 3D unshaded (no lightning) low poly smooth shaded
Project Lead: Liyi Zhang (@liyiz)

# Organisation

Please note that `_assets_src` is for source assets only (the "raw" files that generate the game-ready assets for the engine). There is a `.gdignore` inside the directory so Godot knows to ignore it and not generate meta data for those files. Please refer to the file structure to know where to palce your game-ready assets (or if not available, please ask the project lead)

# Scale Reference

Please refer to the reference scale cube for all assets made for the game.

You can find the source asset here: `\puck2000\_assets_src\misc\scale_ref_cube`
You can find the in-game asset here: `\puck2000\test_scenes\scale_ref`

It is 1unit x 1unit x 1unit in Blender, exported and then imported into Godot with default import options.

# Material Import

Please remember to set the `unshaded` flag to on for the `.material` of any imported 3D model.
